BUILDING from source
--------------------

You will need the flext C++ layer for PD and Max/MSP externals to compile this.
See http://grrrr.org/ext/flext
Download, install and compile the package.
Afterwards you can proceed with building this external.


pd/Max - Windows - Microsoft Visual C, Borland C++, MinGW:
----------------------------------------------------------
Start a command shell with your eventual build environment
(e.g. run vcvars32.bat for Microsoft Visual Studio)

then run
 ..\flext\build.bat
(you would have to substitute ..\flext with the respective path to the flext package)


pd/Max - OSX/Linux - GCC:
-------------------------
From a shell run
bash ../flext/build.sh
(you would have to substitute ../flext with the respective path to the flext package)
